Syntax
SetTexture [TextureName] {Texture Block}
Assigns a texture. TextureName must be defined as a texture property. How to apply the texture is defined inside the TextureBlock.
The texture block controls how the texture is applied. Inside the texture block can be up to three commands: combine, matrix and constantColor.
Texture block combine command
combine src1 * src2: Multiplies src1 and src2 together. The result will be darker than either input.
combine src1 + src2: Adds src1 and src2 together. The result will be lighter than either input.
combine src1 - src2: Subtracts src2 from src1.
combine src1 +- src2: Adds src1 to src2, then subtracts 0.5 (a signed add).
combine src1 lerp (src2) src3: Interpolates between src3 and src1, using the alpha of src2. Note that the interpolation is opposite direction: src1 is used when alpha is one, and src3 is used when alpha is zero.
combine src1 * src2 + src3: Multiplies src1 with the alpha component of src2, then adds src3.
combine src1 * src2 +- src3: Multiplies src1 with the alpha component of src2, then does a signed add with src3.
combine src1 * src2 - src3: Multiplies src1 with the alpha component of src2, then subtracts src3.
All the src properties can be either one of previous, constant, primary or texture. 
Previous is the the result of the previous SetTexture.

Primary is the color from the lighting calculation or the vertex color if it is bound.
Texture is the color of the texture specified by TextureName in the SetTexture (see above).
Constant is the color specified in ConstantColor.
